<section id="results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The logistic regression analysis identified several significant predictors of loan approval:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Income (<span class="math inline">\(\text{person\_income}\)</span>)</strong>: Higher income increases the odds of approval (<span class="math inline">\(p = 0.03536\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Home Ownership</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>OWN</strong>: Owning a home decreases approval odds compared to other home ownership statuses (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>RENT</strong>: Renting increases approval odds compared to other home ownership statuses (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Employment Length (<span class="math inline">\(\text{person\_emp\_length}\)</span>)</strong>: Longer employment length is associated with decreased approval odds (<span class="math inline">\(p = 0.02891\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Loan Amount (<span class="math inline">\(\text{loan\_amnt}\)</span>)</strong>: Higher loan amounts decrease approval odds (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Loan Intent</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>EDUCATION</strong>: Decreases approval odds compared to debt consolidation (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>MEDICAL</strong>: Decreases approval odds compared to debt consolidation (<span class="math inline">\(p = 2.48 \times 10^{-7}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>PERSONAL</strong>: Decreases approval odds compared to debt consolidation (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>VENTURE</strong>: Decreases approval odds compared to debt consolidation (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>HOMEIMPROVEMENT</strong>: No significant effect (<span class="math inline">\(p = 0.925262\)</span>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate (<span class="math inline">\(\text{loan\_int\_rate}\)</span>)</strong>: Higher interest rates increase approval odds (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Loan Percent Income (<span class="math inline">\(\text{loan\_percent\_income}\)</span>)</strong>: Higher loan-to-income ratios increase approval odds (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Credit Score (<span class="math inline">\(\text{credit\_score}\)</span>)</strong>: Higher credit scores are associated with lower approval odds (<span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 2 \times 10^{-16}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Historical Default (<span class="math inline">\(\text{cb\_person\_default\_on\_file}\)</span>)</strong>: Historical default status shows a marginal effect (<span class="math inline">\(p = 0.05624\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Credit History Length (<span class="math inline">\(\text{cb\_person\_cred\_hist\_length}\)</span>)</strong>: No significant effect (<span class="math inline">\(p = 0.20783\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<section id="goodness-of-fit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goodness-of-fit">Goodness of Fit</h3>
<p>The logistic regression model exhibited a residual deviance of 20,549 on 28,622 degrees of freedom, significantly lower than the null deviance of 29,931 on 28,637 degrees of freedom. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was 20,581, indicating a better fit compared to the null model. The dispersion ratio is calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Dispersion Ratio} = \frac{\text{Residual Deviance}}{\text{Degrees of Freedom}} = \frac{20549}{28622} \approx 0.718.
\]</span></p>
<p>A dispersion ratio less than 1 suggests underdispersion, indicating that the model fits the data adequately.</p>
</section>
<section id="residual-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="residual-analysis">Residual Analysis</h3>
<p>When we looked at the residual plot, which shows the differences between the predicted and actual loan approvals, the points were scattered randomly around zero. This randomness means that our model is doing a good job of fitting the data without any obvious mistakes or patterns.</p>

<section id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
<section id="summary-statistics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-statistics">Summary Statistics</h4>
<p>Here are some important numbers from our data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average Loan Amount</strong>: The typical loan requested was about $9,589, with the smallest loan being $500 and the largest up to $35,000.</li>
<li><strong>Average Interest Rate</strong>: The average interest rate was 11.01%, ranging from as low as 5.42% to as high as 23.22%.</li>
<li><strong>Loan Approval Rate</strong>: About 21.83% of the applications were approved, meaning that out of 32,581 applications, 7,108 were successful.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="loan-interest-rates-by-loan-intent" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loan-interest-rates-by-loan-intent">Loan Interest Rates by Loan Intent</h4>
<p>We examined how interest rates differ based on the purpose of the loan. The analysis showed that interest rates vary significantly depending on what the loan is used for. This suggests that lenders set different interest rates based on the loan’s purpose, likely because some purposes are considered riskier than others.</p>
</section>
<section id="loan-percent-income-by-home-ownership" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loan-percent-income-by-home-ownership">Loan Percent Income by Home Ownership</h4>
<p>Next, we looked at how much of an applicant’s income goes towards the loan. The results showed significant differences depending on whether the applicant owns a home, rents, or has another home ownership status. This means that a person’s housing situation influences how much of their income they are willing to allocate to a loan.</p>
</section>
<section id="loan-amount-by-loan-grade" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loan-amount-by-loan-grade">Loan Amount by Loan Grade</h4>
<p>We also explored how the amount of the loan requested varies across different loan grades. The findings revealed significant differences, indicating that the grade or quality of the loan is an important factor in determining how much money is being loaned.</p>
</section>
<section id="credit-history-length-by-loan-status" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="credit-history-length-by-loan-status">Credit History Length by Loan Status</h4>
<p>Finally, we analyzed the length of credit history and found significant differences between those who defaulted on loans and those who did not. This suggests that having a longer credit history is linked to the likelihood of defaulting on a loan.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The results of our analysis show that both financial and personal factors play a big role in whether a loan is approved. For example, people with higher incomes and those who ask for smaller loan amounts are more likely to have their loans approved. This highlights how important financial stability is in getting loan approval.</p>
<p>We also found that people who rent their homes are more likely to have their loans approved compared to those who own their homes or have other home ownership statuses. This could be because lenders see renters as having more flexibility or lower risk. On the other hand, owning a home seems to decrease the chances of loan approval, possibly because it suggests higher financial commitments or risk.</p>
<p>Employment length is another factor we looked at. Surprisingly, those who have been employed longer have lower approval odds. This might mean that being employed for a long time brings up concerns about overemployment or other complexities that lenders consider risky.</p>
<p>The purpose of the loan is also very important. Loans for education, medical expenses, personal use, and ventures are less likely to be approved, which could be because lenders see these purposes as riskier. However, loans for home improvements did not have a significant effect on approval odds.</p>
<p>We also saw that higher interest rates and higher loan-to-income ratios are linked to higher approval odds. This might mean that lenders charge more interest or accept higher loan amounts relative to income to compensate for the increased risk.</p>
<p>One unexpected finding was that higher credit scores are associated with lower approval odds, which goes against what we typically expect. This might be due to errors in the data, problems with the model, or missing important factors that influence loan approval.</p>
<p>Overall, the analysis shows that financial and personal factors are crucial in loan approval decisions. Applicants with better financial profiles, such as higher incomes and lower loan amounts, have better chances of getting approved. However, some findings, like the relationship between credit scores and approval odds, need further investigation to understand the reasons behind them.</p>
<section id="multicollinearity-and-model-fit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multicollinearity-and-model-fit">Multicollinearity and Model Fit</h3>
<p>We checked for multicollinearity, which happens when predictor variables are too closely related. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values were all below 5, which means multicollinearity isn’t a problem in our model. This ensures that the estimates we have for each predictor are reliable. Additionally, the residual analysis showed that the model fits the data well, as the residuals (errors) are randomly scattered without any clear patterns.</p>
</section>
<section id="implications-for-lenders-and-applicants" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-for-lenders-and-applicants">Implications for Lenders and Applicants</h3>
<p>For <strong>lenders</strong>, understanding that higher income and lower loan amounts are favorable can help in refining their lending criteria. The significant impact of loan intent and home ownership on approval odds suggests that these factors should be carefully considered in risk assessments.</p>
<p>For <strong>applicants</strong>, it’s important to know that demonstrating higher income and requesting moderate loan amounts can enhance approval chances. Additionally, the purpose of the loan plays a crucial role, and applicants should align their loan intents with those that have higher approval odds.</p>
</section>
<section id="limitations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>The unexpected negative association between credit scores and approval odds suggests there might be issues with the data quality or the model itself. It’s essential to double-check the data and consider adding other relevant factors that might influence loan approval decisions.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this study, we uncovered several important factors that influence whether a loan application is approved. Individuals with higher incomes and those who rent their homes are more likely to receive loan approvals. Additionally, the reason behind taking out a loan significantly affects the approval outcome. However, we encountered an unexpected result: higher credit scores were associated with lower chances of loan approval. This surprising finding needs further investigation to ensure our model is accurate and the data is trustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Implications</strong>: If you’re applying for a loan, it’s crucial to understand how your income and the amount you’re requesting can impact your approval chances. For lenders, it may be necessary to reevaluate how credit scores are used in the decision-making process to ensure fair and effective risk assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong>: The unexpected negative relationship between credit scores and loan approval suggests there might be issues with the data quality or that our model might be missing some important factors. Additionally, since the dataset was simulated, we don’t have full insight into how the data was generated. This lack of information means we can’t be certain whether the data creation process was intentional or accidental, which could have influenced our results.</p>
