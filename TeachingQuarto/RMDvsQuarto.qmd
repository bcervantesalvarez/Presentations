# Introduction

R Markdown and Quarto are both tools for creating dynamic documents that combine code, outputs, and narrative text. While R Markdown has been a staple in the R community for reproducible research, Quarto is a more recent, language-agnostic tool that extends the capabilities of R Markdown.

This document provides a side-by-side comparison of R Markdown and Quarto to highlight their differences and help you decide which tool is best suited for your needs.

# Document Structure

## YAML Header

Both R Markdown and Quarto use a YAML header to define document metadata, but there are some differences in the syntax and available options.

::: {.columns}

#### **R Markdown**

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author: "Author Name"
date: "2023-10-01"
output: html_document
---
```

#### **Quarto** {#Quarto}

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author: "Author Name"
date: "2023-10-01"
format: html
---
```

:::

**Key Differences:**

- **Output/Format Specification:** R Markdown uses the `output` field, while Quarto uses the `format` field.
- **Consistency:** Quarto's format field is consistent across different output types, simplifying the syntax.

## Sections and Headings

Both tools use Markdown syntax for headings, but Quarto supports additional features like cross-referencing.



#### **R Markdown**

```markdown
# Introduction

This is an introductory section.
```

#### **Quarto**

```markdown
# Introduction {#introduction}

This is an introductory section.
```

**Key Differences:**

- **Explicit IDs:** Quarto allows you to assign IDs to headings for easier cross-referencing.

# Code Execution

## Language Support

While R Markdown is primarily designed for R, it does support other languages via additional setup. Quarto is language-agnostic by default.


#### **R Markdown**


```{r}
# R code example
summary(cars)
```


#### **Quarto**


```{python}
print("Hello, World!")
```


**Key Differences:**

- **Setup Required:** In R Markdown, running Python code might require additional packages like `reticulate`.
- **Built-in Support:** Quarto natively supports multiple languages without extra configuration.

## Code Chunk Options

The syntax for code chunk options differs between the two.

#### **R Markdown**


```r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE
summary(cars)
```


#### **Quarto**


```r
#| echo: false
#| message: false
summary(cars)
```


**Key Differences:**

- **Option Syntax:** R Markdown uses comma-separated options within the chunk header. Quarto uses YAML-like syntax with `#|` prefix inside the chunk.

# Output Formats

## Supported Formats

Quarto supports a wider range of output formats out of the box compared to R Markdown.


#### **R Markdown**

- HTML (`html_document`)
- PDF (`pdf_document`)
- Word (`word_document`)

#### **Quarto**

- HTML (`html`)
- PDF (`pdf`)
- Word (`docx`)
- Presentation formats like Reveal.js, Beamer
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Books and Websites


**Key Differences:**

- **Versatility:** Quarto is designed to create a variety of publication formats without needing additional packages.

# Advanced Features

## Cross-referencing

Quarto provides enhanced cross-referencing capabilities.

#### **R Markdown**

```markdown
See Figure \@ref(fig:plot1).
```

#### **Quarto**

```markdown
See @fig-plot1.
```



**Key Differences:**

- **Simplified Syntax:** Quarto simplifies cross-references with `@` notation.
- **Automatic Numbering:** Quarto handles numbering and referencing more elegantly.

## Extensions and Plugins

Quarto allows for extensions and filters to enhance functionality.


#### **R Markdown**

- Limited to what's provided or requires custom Lua filters.

#### **Quarto**

- Supports Pandoc extensions.
- Allows custom filters and plugins.
- Supports Julia, Python, and R extensions.

# Integration with Editors

## IDE Support


#### **R Markdown**

- Best supported in RStudio.
- Limited support in other editors.

#### **Quarto**

- Supported in RStudio.
- Extensions available for VSCode.
- Support for Jupyter environments.

**Key Differences:**

- **Editor Flexibility:** Quarto offers better integration with a variety of development environments.

# Conclusion

Both R Markdown and Quarto are powerful tools for reproducible research and dynamic report generation. R Markdown is deeply integrated with R and is ideal for R-centric workflows. Quarto, being language-agnostic and feature-rich, is suitable for projects that require flexibility across different programming languages and output formats.

**Consider Quarto if:**

- You work with multiple programming languages.
- You need advanced cross-referencing and output options.
- You prefer a consistent and modern syntax.

**Consider R Markdown if:**

- Your work is primarily in R.
- You are already invested in the R Markdown ecosystem.
- You require compatibility with existing R Markdown documents.
