# Missing Data

## How Missing Data Occurs & Why It Matters

**Common Causes of Missing Data**  

- **Human Error**: Mistakes during entry or recording.  
- **System Failures**: Equipment malfunctions.  
- **Non-response**: Participants can't or won't respond.  
- **Deliberate Omission**: Excluding unreliable data.  

**Why It Matters**  

- **Bias**: Missing data skews parameter estimates and inferences.  
- **Reduced Accuracy**: Less reliable predictions and results.  
- **Power Loss**: Harder to detect meaningful effects.


## Types of Missing Data & MICE Assumptions

**Types of Missing Data**  

- **MCAR**: Missingness is random, no bias.  
- **MAR**: Related to observed data; handled with MICE.  
- **MNAR**: Linked to unobserved data; requires advanced models.  

MICE assumes data is MAR, making it crucial to identify the missingness type to apply the right method.

# M.I.C.E

## What is M.I.C.E.?

**MICE = Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations**

- A statistical method to handle missing data by creating multiple plausible datasets.
- Generates several estimates to reflect uncertainty, rather than a single imputation.

For each variable with missing data $X_j$:

$$
X_j^{(\text{missing})} = f_j(X_{-j}) + \varepsilon_j
$$

- $X_{-j}$: All other variables
- $f_j$: Predictive model (e.g., regression function)
- $\varepsilon_j$: Random error term capturing residuals

*(van Buuren, 2018)*

## Another way to put it

Handling missing data with MICE is like trying to complete a puzzle with missing pieces. Instead of guessing one fixed piece to fill a gap, you evaluate several options that could reasonably fit, based on the surrounding picture. Each plausible "piece" represents a potential imputation, reflecting the uncertainty of the missing data.

## How Does MICE Work?

1. **Initial Imputation**
   - Fill missing values with initial guesses (mean, median, or mode).

2. **Iterative Process**
   - For each variable with missing data $X_j$:
     - **Step 1**: Treat $X_j$ as the target variable.
     - **Step 2**: Use other variables $X_{-j}$ to build a predictive model $f_j$ (e.g., linear regression).
     - **Step 3**: Predict and replace the missing values in $X_j$ using $f_j(X_{-j})$.

3. **Repeat Cycles**
   - Iterate over all variables multiple times until the imputations converge (usually around 10 cycles).

MICE models each variable conditional on others, preserving multivariate relationships and producing statistically valid imputations.

## Study Overview

**Goal**: Assess the impact of missing data patterns on regression analysis and demonstrate how MICE recovers accurate results.

**Dataset**: [Product Sales and Returns](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/product-sales-and-returns-dataset)  
**Problem**: Missing values simulated in **Refunds** column.

**Steps**:  
1. **Data Prep**: Selected **Refunds**, **Purchased Item Count**, **Total Revenue**, **Category**.  
2. **Simulating Missingness**: Applied patterns (**MCAR**, **MAR**, **MNAR**) at 10â€“70% levels.  
3. **MICE Imputation**: Used **mice** package with predictors to fill missing **Refunds**.  
4. **Regression Analysis**: Evaluated the effect of missing patterns and imputation on results.

## Conclusion

  - MICE effectively handles missing data by leveraging multivariate relationships.
  - Maintains data integrity and provides unbiased parameter estimates.

Hence, understanding missing data types is crucial for selecting appropriate imputation methods.

## Evaluation Criteria for Multiple Imputation

- **Raw Bias (RB)**:
  - Difference between the expected estimate and the true value.
  - $\text{RB} = E(\bar{Q}) - Q$
  
- **Percent Bias (PB)**:
  - Relative bias expressed as a percentage.
  - $\text{PB} = 100 \times \left| \frac{E(\bar{Q}) - Q}{Q} \right|$
  
- **Coverage Rate (CR)**:
  - Proportion of confidence intervals that contain the true value.
  - **Goal**: Should be close to the nominal level (e.g., 95%).

- **Average Width (AW)**:
  - Average width of confidence intervals.
  - Indicates statistical efficiency; narrower intervals are more efficient but must maintain adequate coverage.

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
  - Combines bias and variance.
  - $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{E\left( \bar{Q} - Q \right)^2}$

*(van Buuren, 2018)*

**Low Bias and High Coverage**: Indicates randomization-valid methods.

**Efficiency**: Shorter confidence intervals (AW) are better if coverage (CR) is adequate.


## Univariate vs. Multivariate Imputation

- **Univariate Imputation**:
  - Replaces missing values using only the variable itself (mean, median).
  - **Limitation**: Ignores relationships between variables; may distort distributions and underestimate variability.
  
- **Multivariate Imputation (like MICE)**:
  - Uses other variables to estimate missing values.
  - **Advantage**: Preserves covariance structure and maintains data integrity.


## Advantages of MICE

- **Flexibility**:
  - Compatible with various data types (numerical, categorical).
  - Allows for different imputation models per variable.

- **Statistical Validity**:
  - Accounts for uncertainty by creating multiple imputed datasets.
  - Provides unbiased estimates under the MAR assumption.

- **Preserves Data Structure**:
  - Maintains natural variability and multivariate relationships.
  - Reflects the true covariance among variables.

- **Reduces Bias**:
  - More accurate than univariate methods, especially when data is not MCAR.

## Limitations of MICE

- **Computationally Intensive**:
  - Requires more processing time and resources, especially with large datasets.

- **Complexity**:
  - Implementation and tuning can be challenging; requires statistical expertise.

- **Assumptions**:
  - Relies on the data being Missing at Random (MAR).
  - Violations of MAR can lead to biased imputations.

- **Model Dependency**:
  - Quality depends on the correctness of specified models for each variable.
  - Mis-specified models can introduce errors.
  
  
## When Not to Use Multiple Imputation

- **Multiple Imputation** is powerful but not always needed.

- **Complete-Case Analysis** (also known as **Listwise Deletion**):

  - **What is it?**
    - Using only the data entries (rows) that have **no missing values** in the variables you're analyzing.
    - You **exclude** any rows that contain missing data and perform your analysis on the remaining complete cases.

When is Complete-Case Analysis Appropriate?

- If missingness occurs only in $Y$ and the data are **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**.
- Analyzing only the complete cases can be as effective as multiple imputation but is simpler.

**Be Careful**:

  - Using only complete cases can lead to **biased results** when data is **MAR** or **MNAR** and these conditions aren't met.
  - Choosing this method should be a thoughtful decision, and you should **clearly explain** why you're using it, considering how the missing data might affect your analysis.
